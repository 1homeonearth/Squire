"""Feature modules for Squire's Python translation.

This package groups together high-level features originally implemented in
JavaScript. Each module is dependency-free and filled with commentary so readers
can follow every step without outside context. The set includes Rainbow Bridge,
autoban, experience tracking, embed building, moderation commands, and setup
helpers. All outbound Discord I/O should flow through the Rust gateway while
these modules focus on pure data handling.
