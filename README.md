# Squire — Utility Bot for The Unbreakable Crown

Squire is a multi-feature Discord bot that keeps the Unbreakable Crown server network in sync. It forwards activity into a central "Queen's Court" hub, greets new arrivals with bespoke welcome cards, keeps linked channels mirrored across servers, and automatically bans the wave of "mega/link" spam bots that have been raiding the community.

The project is written in modern ECMAScript modules on top of [`discord.js` v14](https://discord.js.org/#/docs/discord.js/main/general/welcome) and runs on Node.js 22 or newer. Feature modules live in `src/features/*` and are dynamically discovered at startup so that functionality can grow without touching the core runtime.

## Getting the code

Clone the repository with Git:

```bash
export SQUIRE_REPO="https://github.com/Unbreakable-Crown/Squire.git"
git clone "$SQUIRE_REPO"
cd Squire
```

Or fetch an archive without Git:

```bash
export SQUIRE_TARBALL="https://github.com/Unbreakable-Crown/Squire/archive/refs/heads/main.tar.gz"
curl -L "$SQUIRE_TARBALL" | tar -xz
cd Squire-main
```

## Features

- **Logging forwarder** (`src/features/logging-forwarder/`)
  - Mirrors channel activity from each source guild into mapped webhooks in the Queen's Court.
  - Respects per-guild channel/category exclusion lists and a configurable sampling rate.
  - Fully managed through the `/setup` overview — designate the logging server, mark the main servers, and from any guild link them to logging channels (Squire creates/updates the webhooks), configure exclusions, toggle bot forwards, and adjust sampling without editing files.
- **Welcome cards** (`src/features/welcome-cards/`)
  - Builds Mee6-style welcome cards using [Canvacord](https://www.npmjs.com/package/canvacord) with avatar + banner overlays.
  - Posts reminder text pointing newcomers to the rules/roles/verification channels (with configurable channel mentions) and announces departures.
- **Auto bouncer** (`src/features/auto-bouncer/`)
  - Instantly bans unverified accounts whose username, display name, or global name contains known spam terms (mega/megas/link/links by default).
  - Optional notification channel/webhooks + verified-role exemptions so trusted members or staff can bypass the filter.
  - Persists every decision (success, permission failure, unexpected error) to the LokiJS database for auditability.
- **Rainbow Bridge** (`src/features/rainbow-bridge/`)
  - Mirrors messages, edits, and deletions across linked channels spanning multiple guilds.
  - Supports per-bridge overrides for bot forwarding, friendly bridge names, and automatic embed cleanup for rich media.
- **Setup panel** (`src/features/setup/`)
  - Provides the `/setup` slash command that gives admins an in-Discord control panel for every module.
  - Manages logging destinations, welcome channel reminders, rainbow bridge links, and autobouncer keywords without editing `config.json` manually.

## Development workflow

1. **Install prerequisites** — Node.js 22+ and npm 10+.
2. **Install dependencies** — `npm install`.
3. **Run linting & tests** — `npm run lint` and `npm test` before pushing changes.
4. **Type check (optional)** — `npm run build` invokes `tsc -p .` to surface declaration issues.
5. **Deploy slash commands** — `npm run deploy:commands` publishes `/setup` (and any future commands) to the configured guilds.

For production hosts, the `squirectl` helper wraps deployment tasks (fetching from `origin/main`, running `npm ci`, rendering config from environment, and managing the systemd unit).

## Deployment tracks

### Track 1 — Local collaborator workstation

Local collaborators should keep secrets out of source control by exporting them into the current shell before rendering config and starting the bot:

```bash
export DISCORD_TOKEN="paste-your-discord-bot-token"
export DISCORD_APPLICATION_ID="paste-your-application-id"
export WEBHOOK_SERVER_1129906023084343346="https://discord.com/api/webhooks/..."
export WEBHOOK_SERVER_1391983429553492049="https://discord.com/api/webhooks/..."
export RAINBOW_BRIDGE_MAIN_ONE_WEBHOOK="https://discord.com/api/webhooks/..."
export RAINBOW_BRIDGE_MAIN_TWO_WEBHOOK="https://discord.com/api/webhooks/..."
export AUTOBAN_NOTIFY_WEBHOOK="https://discord.com/api/webhooks/..."
NODE_ENV=development npm ci
node scripts/render-config.mjs
npm start
```

The one-liner `NODE_ENV=development npm ci && node scripts/render-config.mjs && npm start` works once the exports are present. Re-run `node scripts/render-config.mjs` any time you change environment variables so the working `config.json` stays in sync.

### Track 2 — Codex cloud environment

The Codex cloud runner is intended for automated validation (lint + tests) without touching production secrets. Inject credentials through the task environment, then execute the CI-style pipeline:

```bash
export DISCORD_TOKEN="${DISCORD_TOKEN:?set in cloud secret store}"
export DISCORD_APPLICATION_ID="${DISCORD_APPLICATION_ID:?set in cloud secret store}"
export WEBHOOK_SERVER_1129906023084343346="${WEBHOOK_SERVER_1129906023084343346:?set in cloud secret store}"
export WEBHOOK_SERVER_1391983429553492049="${WEBHOOK_SERVER_1391983429553492049:?set in cloud secret store}"
export RAINBOW_BRIDGE_MAIN_ONE_WEBHOOK="${RAINBOW_BRIDGE_MAIN_ONE_WEBHOOK:?set in cloud secret store}"
export RAINBOW_BRIDGE_MAIN_TWO_WEBHOOK="${RAINBOW_BRIDGE_MAIN_TWO_WEBHOOK:?set in cloud secret store}"
export AUTOBAN_NOTIFY_WEBHOOK="${AUTOBAN_NOTIFY_WEBHOOK:?set in cloud secret store}"
NODE_ENV=production npm ci
node scripts/render-config.mjs
npm run lint && npm test && npm run build
```

The condensed Codex check-in command is:

```bash
NODE_ENV=production npm ci && node scripts/render-config.mjs && npm run lint && npm test && npm run build
```

Use `squirectl status` if you need to confirm the live deployment state from cloud automation without mutating it:

```bash
export SQUIRE_HOST="mcs.example.net"
ssh -p 123 squire@"$SQUIRE_HOST" "squirectl status"
```

### Track 3 — Systemd production host

On the Debian 13 production host, environment variables are sourced by systemd (for example via `/etc/systemd/system/squire.service.d/env.conf`). After editing the environment drop-in, reload systemd and use `squirectl` for lifecycle management:

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart squire.service
```

Routine deployments use the helper directly:

```bash
export SQUIRE_HOST="mcs.example.net"
ssh -p 123 squire@"$SQUIRE_HOST" "squirectl deploy"
```

The script performs `git fetch --all --prune`, `git reset --hard origin/main`, `npm ci --omit=dev`, runs `node ./scripts/render-config.mjs`, and restarts the `squire` systemd unit while showing a concise status tail. Operators can check health without redeploying:

```bash
ssh -p 123 squire@"$SQUIRE_HOST" "squirectl status"
```

If you must restart without pulling new code, run:

```bash
ssh -p 123 squire@"$SQUIRE_HOST" "squirectl restart"
```

Always export new secret values into the unit environment before invoking any `squirectl` command so the render step can resolve them.

## Getting started

1. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Provide secrets via environment variables**

   ```bash
   export DISCORD_TOKEN="paste-your-discord-bot-token"
   export DISCORD_APPLICATION_ID="paste-your-application-id"
   export WEBHOOK_SERVER_1129906023084343346="https://discord.com/api/webhooks/..."
   export WEBHOOK_SERVER_1391983429553492049="https://discord.com/api/webhooks/..."
   export RAINBOW_BRIDGE_MAIN_ONE_WEBHOOK="https://discord.com/api/webhooks/..."
   export RAINBOW_BRIDGE_MAIN_TWO_WEBHOOK="https://discord.com/api/webhooks/..."
   export AUTOBAN_NOTIFY_WEBHOOK="https://discord.com/api/webhooks/..."
   ```

   Non-secret values (IDs, sampling values, etc.) can stay in `config.sample.json` or be overridden after rendering.

3. **Render `config.json` from the environment**

   ```bash
   node scripts/render-config.mjs
   ```

   The script deep-merges any existing `config.json`, resolves `$ENV{...}` placeholders, and fails fast if required env variables are missing. Update non-secret settings by editing `config.json` after rendering.

4. **Run the bot**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The process logs its status to stdout and gracefully handles `SIGINT`/`SIGTERM`.

## Configuration reference

All configuration lives in `config.json`, which is materialised by `scripts/render-config.mjs` using environment variables for every secret. Set secrets (tokens, webhooks, and other sensitive values) through the environment, then render the file. Relevant keys:

| Key | Description |
| --- | ----------- |
| `token` | Discord bot token (`DISCORD_TOKEN` env alternative). |
| `applicationId` | Bot application/client ID (`APPLICATION_ID`). |
| `dbPath` | Path to the LokiJS persistence file (defaults to `./squire.db.json`). |
| `loggingServerId` | Guild that receives forwarded logs and slash command deployments (`LOGGING_SERVER_ID`). |
| `sampleRate` | Float between 0 and 1 for the logging forwarder (fraction of messages forwarded). |
| `forwardBots` | Forward bot-authored messages when `true`. |
| `debugLevel` | `none`, `info`, or `verbose` to control console logging verbosity. |
| `mapping` | Object mapping **source guild IDs** to **destination webhook URLs** in the Queen's Court. |
| `loggingChannels` | Optional map of log categories (`messages`, `moderation`, `joins`, `system`) to dedicated channel IDs in the logging server. |
| `excludeChannels` | Per-guild arrays of source channel IDs to ignore while forwarding. |
| `excludeCategories` | Per-guild arrays of category IDs to ignore while forwarding. |
| `rainbowBridge` | Two-way bridge config block (see below). |
| `featureOrder` | Optional array of feature folder names to control load/listener registration order. |
| `autoban` | Auto-bouncer config block (see below). |
| `welcome` | Welcome card config block (see below). |

### Rainbow Bridge config

```json
"rainbowBridge": {
  "forwardBots": true,
  "bridges": {
    "main-halls": {
      "name": "Main Halls",
      "channels": [
        {
          "guildId": "123456789012345678",
          "channelId": "234567890123456789",
          "webhookUrl": "https://discord.com/api/webhooks/..."
        },
        {
          "guildId": "987654321098765432",
          "channelId": "876543210987654321",
          "webhookUrl": "https://discord.com/api/webhooks/..."
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

- `forwardBots` controls whether bot-authored posts are mirrored globally; individual bridges can override this with their own `forwardBots` flag.
- Each bridge lists the guild/channel pairs that should stay in sync. Provide the channel's webhook URL so Squire can speak in that channel.
- The Rainbow Bridge setup panel can automatically create webhooks when it has the **Manage Webhooks** permission, or you can paste an existing webhook URL.
- Add at least two channels per bridge for syncing to begin. Edits and deletions propagate between every linked channel.

### Auto-bouncer config

```json
"autoban": {
  "enabled": true,
  "blockedUsernames": ["mega", "megas", "link", "links"],
  "notifyChannelId": "CHANNEL_ID_FOR_LOGGING_ACTIONS",
  "notifyWebhookUrls": ["https://discord.com/api/webhooks/..."],
  "deleteMessageSeconds": 0
}
```

- Set `enabled` to `false` to disable the module without removing it.
- `blockedUsernames` is case-insensitive and deduplicated; supply any suspicious keywords you want to catch.
- `notifyChannelId` is optional; when set, the bot posts success/failure messages into that text channel.
- `notifyWebhookUrls` is optional; provide one or more webhook URLs to receive the same moderation log events inside a dedicated logging server.
- `deleteMessageSeconds` controls how far back Discord should purge the member's messages when banning (0 keeps history).

For CI/CD you can provide a full JSON blob through `AUTOBAN_CONFIG_JSON` to override the file at deploy time.

### Welcome card config

```json
"welcome": {
  "123456789012345678": {
    "channelId": "WELCOME_CHANNEL_ID",
    "message": "Welcome {{user}} to {{guild}}!\nPlease read our {{rules}}, select your {{roles}}, and then {{verify}} to unlock the full server.",
    "mentions": {
      "rules": "RULES_CHANNEL_ID",
      "roles": "ROLES_CHANNEL_ID",
      "verify": "VERIFY_CHANNEL_ID"
    }
  }
}
```

- Each key in the map is a guild ID. The optional `channelId` forces the welcome module to post into a specific text channel instead of auto-detecting one by name.
- The `mentions` block replaces the placeholder channel names in the welcome reminder text with proper clickable mentions for that guild.
- The optional `message` string customises the text sent alongside the welcome card. Leave it empty to fall back to the default.
- Supported placeholders inside the message template:
  - `{{user}}` — Mention of the new member.
  - `{{username}}` — Discord username of the new member.
  - `{{usertag}}` — Legacy username#discriminator tag when available.
  - `{{displayname}}` — Server display name or global name for the member.
  - `{{guild}}` — Name of the server the member just joined.
  - `{{rules}}`, `{{roles}}`, `{{verify}}` — Mentions (or fallbacks) to the configured channels.
  - `{{membercount}}` — Current cached member count for the server.

### In-Discord setup panel

The `/setup` command opens an overview for operators with the **Manage Server** permission:

- Pick the logging server and the list of “main” servers once, then jump into the Logging, Welcome Cards, or Autobouncer modules from any guild.
- Logging — select which main server to configure, link it to a logging channel inside the logging server, manage excluded channels/categories, assign dedicated logging categories, and tune the sampling/bot-forwarding options.
- Welcome Cards — choose a target server, set its welcome channel, and pick (or clear) the rules/roles/verify references individually.
- Rainbow Bridge — link channels across servers so messages, edits, and deletions stay in sync everywhere.
- Autobouncer — toggle the module, edit the blocked keyword list, and choose the logging server channel that receives autobounce notifications.

Every change is persisted to `config.json`, so redeploys and restarts keep the configured state without manual file edits.

## Environment variables

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `DISCORD_TOKEN` | Overrides `config.token`. |
| `APPLICATION_ID` | Overrides `config.applicationId`. |
| `LOGGING_SERVER_ID` | Overrides `config.loggingServerId`. |
| `MAPPING_JSON` | JSON string (object) that replaces `config.mapping`. |
| `EXCLUDE_CHANNELS_JSON` | JSON object overriding `config.excludeChannels`. |
| `EXCLUDE_CATEGORIES_JSON` | JSON object overriding `config.excludeCategories`. |
| `AUTOBAN_CONFIG_JSON` | JSON object overriding the entire `config.autoban` block. |

## Managing slash commands

The repo ships with helper scripts for iterating on slash commands without waiting for global propagation:

- `npm run deploy:commands` – Deploys commands to the logging server guild (fast, for testing).
- `npm run cmds:list` – Lists global + guild slash commands for quick inspection.
- `npm run cmds:wipe:guild` / `npm run cmds:wipe:global` – Removes commands without triggering Discord's entry-point errors.

All scripts read from env variables first, then fall back to `config.json`.

## Database

Squire uses [LokiJS](https://github.com/techfort/LokiJS) for lightweight storage. The default `squire.db.json` file is safe to commit if it does not contain secrets, but you can change the location via `dbPath` or point it at a proper database volume in production.

Moderation decisions from the auto-bouncer land in a `moderation_events` collection (with timestamps, matched term, guild, and status) so staff can investigate why a user was banned or why an action failed.

## Testing

Run the growing automated suite with:

```bash
npm test
```

The Node.js test runner covers high-risk logic such as the auto-bouncer’s moderation logging and the `/setup` control panel rendering. Add new `.test.js` files under `tests/` to extend coverage.

## Development tips

- Keep Node.js up to date (>= 18.17) so `discord.js` and `canvacord` native dependencies work correctly.
- Feature modules are standard ES modules that export an `init(ctx)` function. The loader passes `{ client, config, logger, db }`.
- Avoid deprecated Discord API options such as `deleteMessageDays`; the code base already uses the modern replacements.
- When adding new features, create a new folder under `src/features/` with an `index.js` export—no extra wiring needed.
