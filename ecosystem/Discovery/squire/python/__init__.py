"""
Package marker for the Squire bot's Python code.

Keeping this file (even if it only contains comments) tells Python that this
folder is a package so imports like ``from crypto import secrets`` work when
``PYTHONPATH`` points here. Removing it would break those imports and make the
code harder to learn from, so it stays with a short explanation instead.
